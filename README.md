# lagar.io

This was a project made by me in 6th grade to learn a little about node.js and canvas. It is essentially a clone of [agar.io](http://agar.io) with less features.


## Features
* Custom names
* Eating food / growing
* **Eating other players!**

### Note about eating
Because I was not a very good programmer in sixth grade, when you get eaten your game will either be frozen or a death message will appear. The console errors that ensue are an added feature.

### Security
Nearly everything in the app is logged in the backend. Do not use any personal information as your player name.

## How to play
Go to [http://boiling-inlet-1806.herokuapp.com](http://boiling-inlet-1806.herokuapp.com) to play. It will take a few seconds for the dyno to start up.

### No one to play with?
Just open a new tab and play against yourself!
